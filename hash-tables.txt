Hash Tables

1. What is a hash table?
Hash table is a type of data structure that stores each value by linking it to a key, forming key-value pairs.

2.What is hashing?
A process of converting arbitrary data into a fixed-length hash code using a hashing function.Hashing is the conversion from a string to a numerical index. 

3.How does a hash table store data?
Hash tables are commonly used to store data by some form of identifier, are intended to be used as collections of similar data.

4.How are hash tables and objects different?
Objects are used when data is a static number of distinct values of different types.
For hash tables, one would look at the nature of the data and when data is a list of values with no need for an identifier.

5.Determine whether you would use a hash table or an object to store each of the following pieces of data:
-A list of pets and their unique names.
hash table
-The name, age, and the birthday of your best friend.
object
-The name and location of every company in a given city.
hash table
-All of the books checked out from a library by a particular individual.
hash table
-The primary and secondary phone numbers for a contact.
object

6.Build a system that allows a sales associate to enter a customer's name, address, and phone number into the system and look up customers using their phone numbers. Store this information in a hash table.

function createCustomerInfo (name, address, phoneNumber){
	CREATE HashMapName 
	CREATE HashMapAddress 
	CREATE HashMapPhoneNumber
	STORE phoneNumber (key) with name and address (values)
}

function lookupCustomer(phoneNumber){
	IF customer does NOT have phoneNumber
           PRINT ’New customer needs to be created’
	ELSE IF customer has phoneNumber
	   RETURN customer information
        ELSE customer phoneNumber doesn’t match
	   PRINT ‘Customer doesn’t exist’
        END IF
}

7.Build a system that allows a store owner to track their store's inventory using a hash table for storage.

function createStoreInventory(itemName, itemNumber, inStock){
	CREATE HashMapInventory
	STORE itemNumber (key) in HashMapInventory with itemName and inStock status(values)
}

function trackInventory(itemNumber){
	IF itemNumber is in HashMapInventory 
	   RETURN itemName and inStock status
	ELSE 
	   PRINT ’The itemName doesn’t exist’
        END IF
}

8.Build a system that allows digital copies of newspapers to be entered and searched by publisher and publication date. Use hash tables to store the necessary data.

function createDigitalNewspaper(publisher, publicationDate){
	CREATE HashMapNewspaper with publisher and publicationDate for each digital copy
	STORE publicationDate (key) with publisher (value) per copy in HashMapNewspaper
}

function findNewspaper(publicationDate){
	IF  publicationDate is in HashMapNewspaper
	   RETURN publicationDate and publisher
	ELSE
	   PRINT ‘publicationDate is not available’
	END IF
}
