Short Answer

1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?
Pseudocode helps programmers to develop algorithms.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?
Pseudocode is meant for humans to read rather than machines, so it will not run on a computer.

Programming Assignment
Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

1.Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

FUNCTION printGreaterNumber (numberOne,numberTwo)
If numberOne is greater than numberTwo 
    PRINT numberOne
ELSE
    PRINT numberTwo

2.Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

SET initial number to 1
FOR numbers starting at 1
	ADD 1 to each number 
	PRINT all numbers until the number is 100
ENDFOR

3.Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

FUNCTION phonebookSearch (entry)
if array has specific entry in a phonebook 
    PRINT entry found
ELSE   
    PRINT entry not found
END FUNCTION

4.Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

var phonebook = ['jenny','joy','josh'];
function findEntry(entry) {
	for(var i = 0; i < phonebook.length; i++){
		if(entry === phonebook[i]){
            return 'Entry was found!';
		}
	}
	return 'Entry was not found!';
}


findEntry('jenny') //"Entry was found!"
findEntry('sam')  // "Entry was not found!"
